	,"description" : "Village Connect’s CBTC’s mission is to build the capacity of people to become more self-aware and self-directed resulting in sustainable positive transformation. Our philosphy of change is steeped in a culturally competent approach that is client-centered and sensitive to the gender-specific and inter-generational dynamics critical to the individual and group. CBTC is a strength-based coaching model that maximizes personal, professional, and academic potential. Coaches/Facilitators trained in the CBTC model support clients to meet life’s opportunities and challenges by providing insights and guidance from an inside/out perspective rather than outside/in. Utilizing a culturally proficient curriculum and community-based interdisciplinary approach, Village Connect effectively transforms the individual, family, and community. www.village-connect.org"
