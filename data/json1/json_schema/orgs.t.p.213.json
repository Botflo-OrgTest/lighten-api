Inspired by our core values of compassion, social justice and spirituality, we are committed to bringing wellness, recovery and clinical best practices to all who come through our doors. Using a harm reduction model, the Wellness Center strives to meet people where they are by focusing on lending continued support to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues and other debilitating diagnoses. Our daily program consists of stress reduction techniques, exercise, selections of personal and spiritual development as well as health topic sessions. Good nutritional guidelines play a pivotal role at the Wellness Center. We offer healthy free snacks and lunch based on a thoughtfully designed menu of fresh local foods with high/dense nutritional value. All are welcome and encouraged to participate on the level that best fits their needs.  www.svdp-sf.org"
