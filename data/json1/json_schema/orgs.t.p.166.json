	,"description" : "The St. Anthony Foundation’s Father Alfred Center provides the Bay Area’s only licensed no-fee residential recovery program to homeless men who are ready to build sober, stable futures. The program serves men from San Francisco, Marin, Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Mateo counties. The Father Alfred Center’s year-long work-structured program empowers men with no income or resources with the tools to overcome addiction, and the support to establish productive and healthy lives. The multi-program access available through St. Anthony’s own services is rare in the field of recovery, and allows the speedy assessment and resolution of clients’ medical, legal, vocational, and educational needs, most or all of which have been affected profoundly by their cycles of poverty and addiction. www.stanthonysf.org/RecoveryProgram"
