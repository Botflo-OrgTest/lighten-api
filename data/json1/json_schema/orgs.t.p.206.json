	,"description" : "The primary goal of the NoVA Project is to address the violence plaguing San Francisco and in particular, the significantly high crime communities of Bayview Hunters Point, Western Addition, and the Mission Districts, by providing intensive services to formerly incarcerated individuals with a history of violence to aid in their reentry into the community and reduce recidivism. The NoVA Project approach engages men and women, and encourages them to take control of their violent behavior through rehabilitation, and to the extent possible, successfully reenter the community as a productive member of society. This comprehensive approach stresses offender accountability and violence prevention education. www.sfsheriff.com"
