	,"description" : "Our primary goal is to change an individual's substance-abusing lifestyle. This change comes about through four fundamental processes. First, individuals must acknowledge their problems, their own roles and responsibilities in abusing substances. Second, they must have the willingness to resolve and change their substance abusing behavior. Third, there needs to be an understanding and reconciliation of any conflict within themselves, their families and cultural traditions. Finally, they need to develop abilities and skills in managing their lives in the social, economic, and political reality of their environment and community. The AARS-residential is a therapeutic community which recognizes the need for providing structure, support and opportunity within a multi-cultural environment. It is a highly structured environment with defined boundaries, both moral and ethical. The program employs community imposed sanctions as well as earned advancement of status and privileges as part of the recovery and growth process. Being part of something greater than oneself is an especially important factor in facilitating positive growth. www.aars.org"
