	,"description" : "The Latino Commission program design and methodology are derived from models of culturally-sensitive treatment for Latinos, which have been developed and implemented in the last decade by the Latino Commission. The model incorporates current best practices in services delivery to Latinos utilizing a solid family-centered approach, one that integrates the concepts of conocimiento (self-awareness), respeto (respect for others), and confianza (mutual trust) to create a traditional peer support system. www.thelatinocommission.org"
